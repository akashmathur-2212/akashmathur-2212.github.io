# Professional Experience

## CGI, Amsterdam, Netherlands
*Senior ML Engineer (Sep 2024 – Present)*

- Achieved `60%` faster proposal responses by engineering a `RAG` system with `agentic` memory, tools, and custom prompts, accelerating `RFI` evaluations and enabling quicker sales decisions.
- Transformed data discovery by designing a `hybrid` search engine with `LLM`-powered re-ranking, reducing `time to insights` by `50%` and making global data platform more intuitive and user-centric.
- Leveraged `LLMs` to generate task-specific `synthetic` data using PyTorch, enhancing model performance and reducing `bias` in AI systems.
- Implemented `medallion` architecture to build scalable pipelines that cleaned, enriched, and secured `unstructured` data, making them `auditable` and `AI`-ready.

## S&P Global, Gurugram, India
*Senior ML Engineer – Automotive Supply Chain Technology & Aftermarket (Jun 2021 – Aug 2024)*

- Generated `$500k+` in revenue by architecting end-to-end product on `AWS` that forecast Vehicles `Scrappage`. Setup Feature store and model `monitoring` with `SageMaker` to track and analyze metrics.
- Automated model `deployment` and `serving` with FastAPI through an efficient `CI/CD` integrated serverless workflow using AWS, Docker, Terraform and GitHub.
- Reduced daily news processing time by `80%` by architecting end-to-end application on AWS. It recommends top news articles through `similarity` search and summaries generated from a `fine-tuned` FLAN-T5 model. 
- Improved customer satisfaction and product quality by employing `sentiment` analysis using a `fine-tuned` RoBERTa model and identifying prevalent issues using `topic modelling` via BERTopic on AWS. 

## Bank of America – Gurugram, India
*Assistant Manager - Quantitative Modelling (Nov 2018 – Jun 2021)*

- Improved bank’s risk and capital management by forecasting Equities Trading Account Profit revenue using Linear Regression as a part of regulatory compliance. 
- Reduced monthly processing time by `90%` by designing `ETL` pipelines tailored for large-scale data and leveraging `ARIMA` for revenue forecasting using `Databricks`.
- Demonstrated proficiency in Information Extraction from disparate sources and utilizing advanced analytical techniques and algorithms to make it actionable for stakeholders.

## Credit Suisse – Pune, India
*Analyst, Advanced Analytics - Global Markets Technology (May 2015 – Nov 2018)*

- Enhanced the bank’s risk management practices by designing `ETL` pipelines, enabling precise identification of high-risk hedge fund investors with the Random Forest classifier.
- Optimized product offerings by 40% through segmentation using `Dimensionality Reduction` and `Clustering` Techniques to identify distinct client groups, leading to deeper customer understanding.
