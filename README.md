# Professional Experience

## S&P Global – Mobility, Gurugram, India
*Senior Data Scientist – Automotive Supply Chain Technology & Aftermarket (Jun 2021 – Present)*

- Launched an ML product that uncovers market trends and forecasts Vehicles Scrappage helping businesses to identify recycling trends. It was integrated into several downstream products, contributing to sustainable value creation and revenue growth.
- Engineered a `CI/CD` integrated `serverless` workflow leveraging AWS and Docker. Automated the infrastructure workflow with Terraform for managing, versioning, and collaborating on infrastructure changes.
- Reduced daily news processing time by `80%` by building and deploying a CI/CD integrated `serverless` AWS workflow. It recommends top-N news articles based on similarity search (`Faiss`) and abstractive news summarization using `FLAN-T5` model. 
- Improved customer satisfaction and product quality by building and deploying a `serverless` AWS workflow that identifies prevalent issues using topic modelling (`BERTopic`) and Sentiment Analysis using `BERT` to analyse customer reviews. 
- Accelerated performance by `10X` through optimization of a long-running query using Spark, processing gigabytes of data on Azure Databricks, and deriving actionable insights for internal stakeholders using `Power BI`.

## Bank of America – Gurugram, India
*Assistant Manager - Quantitative Modelling (Nov 2018 – Jun 2021)*

- Improved bank’s risk and capital management by forecasting Equities Trading Account Profit revenue for 9 quarters using Linear Regression under several economic scenarios as a part of regulatory requirement using `Azure Machine Learning`. 
- Reduced monthly processing time by `90%` by constructing automated ETL pipelines for large-scale Non-Interest Income data using `Azure Databricks`. Integrated the output into various downstream products crucial for revenue forecasting.
- Demonstrated proficiency in Information Extraction through the integration of diverse data sources, including text, PDFs, APIs, and scanned images with OCR, to construct robust data pipelines for multiple downstream tasks.

## CREDIT SUISSE – Pune, India
*Client Finance Analytics - Global Markets Technology (May 2015 – Nov 2018)*

- Improved risk management through the identification of high-risk hedge fund investors by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and constructing a Machine Learning model with an AUC-ROC score of 0.82 using Random Forest.
- Optimized product offerings by 40% through the implementation of Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering Techniques, including `K-Means` and `DBSCAN`, to identify and analyse distinct client groups, thereby gaining valuable insights into their behaviour.

# Projects
- Developed versatile applications powered by `Large Language Model (LLM)`, including conversational AI `chatbot`, `semantic search` and `text summarization`, coupled with UI creation using `LangChain` and `LlamaIndex`.
- Implemented fine-tuning strategies in `RAG` applications, optimizing both ingestion (`chunking, metadata, multi-indexing`) and inferencing (`query transformations, advanced retrieval strategies, re-ranking`) stages for enhanced performance
